  <h2>Let's talk to your idol!</h2>
<p>There’s no exact things on how to make your idol/bias talking to you especially for korean idols. But here are my recommendations. Good luck!</p>
<P>1. Be their staff</p>
<P>Tired of not getting noticed by your idols? Why don’t you work for them? Be their manager, make up artist or staff will make you close with them. You will get paid for doing what you love. So, if you’re good in korean, you may start finding information on how to be their staff and make an application!
<P>2. Get their attention through their Vlive</p>
<P>Tough competition between fans happens when it comes to get your comment mentioned by idols. But here are some tips from my friend ,
Be QUICK in greeting when your idol just start their live cam. Don’t be a spammer, it’s annoying.
Type in their language. It’ll be easily noticed by your idol if you type in their native tongue. For example : 밥 먹었어요? - have you eaten? or (X) 너무 잘 생겼어요! -X is really handsome!
Change your name in hangul. If you have non-korean name, translate it hangul so your idol can notice your unique name and even read it out!.</p>
<P>3. Go to idol’s fanmeeting/ fansigning</p>
<P>You’re required to buy their albums. Usually most of the groups using lottery-based system. Fans who purchase albums at will be entered in a raffle, and a specified amount of fans will be able to attend a fansign/fanmeet. The more albums you buy, the more entries into the raffle you will get, so the higher your chance of being able to see and talk to your idol. Remember! You’re lucky enough if you have a chance to talk to your idol, use the chance wisely!</p>
<P>4. Get a funny banner in their concert</p>
<P>If you want at least they looking at you, bring a huge funny or embarrassing banner of your idol. The chance of talking with them might be really small due to the crowd. At least a little notice will make your day right?</p>
<P>5. If all fails, burst into tears!</p>
<P>Since it’s frustrating on how hard it is to communicate with your idols, why don’t you shed a few tears? If not, eyedrops are always handy. A little drama might catch your idol attention. If you’re lucky enough they can calm you down and thanks you for supporting them.</p>
<P>If the list seems possible to make you closer with idol, then I wish you a good luck. If you're lucky, you might even get a word of comfort from your idol!</p>
